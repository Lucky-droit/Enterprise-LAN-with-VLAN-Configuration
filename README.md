# Enterprise LAN with VLAN Configuration

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an enterprise LAN using VLAN-based segmentation. Cisco switches and a router are configured to logically separate network traffic, enable inter-VLAN communication, and verify connectivity using Cisco IOS commands.

The lab focuses on core enterprise LAN concepts and basic troubleshooting practices.
